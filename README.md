# Prosper-Loan-Data-Exploration

The Prosper Loan dataset contains data about 110,000 loan listings and 81 features relating to the loan, services and differemt segments of loan applicants. The goal of this exploration was to discover patterns in the data about the different segments of borrowers, the reasons they borrow and the variables that influence their probability of getting a loan.

## Findings
Firstly, exploration on this dataset revealed Debt consolidation, Home Improvement, and Business purpose as the major reasons why people take loans. Borrowing to purchase boats and RVs turned out to be the least reasons why people get loans. The data also revealed a positive correlation between the income of the borrower and the loan amount they got, which is the same between the loan amount and the monthly payment made.

As expected, being a home owner seemed to increase the chances of getting a higher amount of loan. I hypothesize that this s because homeowners could be perceived as having more stability and a valuable collateral. California residents ranked highest among states with people who take loans, while Professionals and Computer Programmers took more loans than people in other professions.

## Conclusion
Exploring the data revealed pattern that would have never been assumed correctly by mere intuition, and this emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision making in and outside the organisation. With this information, loan comoanies can better target prospects with the right marketing messages and help focus their campaigns and product offerings to the appropriate market segments, saving marketing costs and achieving significant results.
